# Code Refactor Starter Code
This website has been updated to follow accessibility standards by adding alt attributes to the images appearing on the page.
The code within both index and css has been cleaned up by either fixing code to help it perform its intended action(like a link leading to its proper location) or some of the code being grouped together for more readablity. The HTML elements follow a logical structure and the title has also changed to be more descriptive of the website.
