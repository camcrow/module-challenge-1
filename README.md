This website has been updated to follow accessibility standards by adding alt attributes to the iages on the website.
The HTML elements within the page have a logical structure and the heading attributes fall in sequential order.
Changes have been made within the code to either fix it such as links now leading to their respective places or code (such as some in css) now being grouped together for clear readability. Also the title of the website has been changed to a more descriptive title.
